   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   <i>Continuation Passing Style</i> (<small>CPS</small>) is a style
   of programming in which functions do not return values. Instead, when a
   function is called, it is given another function, called its
   <i>continuation.</i> When the function produces a value, it calls its
   continuation with the value, instead of returning that value. In this way,
   the same function can provide no values (by never calling its continuation),
   one value (by calling its continuation once), two values (by calling its
   continuation twice), etc. It can even provide <i>n</i> values, where
   <i>n</i> is a number not known in advance, by calling its continuation
   <i>n</i> times. In this computer laboratory, you will write a
   <small>CPS</small> function that produces all permutations of a list.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Suppose that <i>l</i> is a finite list of zero or more distinct
   elements (so there are no duplicates). Then a <i>permutation</i> of
   <i>l</i> is either <i>l</i> itself, or else a list made by
   rearranging the elements of <i>l.</i> For example, the OCaml list
   <tt>[0;&nbsp;1;&nbsp;2]</tt> has six possible permutations, shown
   below.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>[0;&nbsp;1;&nbsp;2]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[0;&nbsp;2;&nbsp;1]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[1;&nbsp;0;&nbsp;2]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[1;&nbsp;2;&nbsp;0]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[2;&nbsp;0;&nbsp;1]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[2;&nbsp;1;&nbsp;0]</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   If <i>l</i> has <i>n</i> distinct elements, then it has
   <i>n</i>! permutations. This is because there are <i>n</i>
   possible choices for the first element of a permutation,
   <i>n</i>&#8722;1 choices for the second element, <i>n</i>&#8722;2
   choices for the third element, etc., until finally there is only one choice
   left for the last element. As a result, the total number of permutations is:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <i>n</i>! = <i>n</i> &#215; (<i>n</i>&#8722;1) &#215;
    (<i>n</i>&#8722;2) &#8943; &#215; 2 &#215; 1
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   The number of permutations rises rapidly as the length of the list
   <i>l</i> increases. For example, a list with ten elements has
   10!&nbsp;= 3628800 possible permutations.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now suppose we want to generate all possible
   permutations of a large list; perhaps we want to know if one of them has an
   interesting property. Since there are so many permutations, it may take too
   much memory to generate them all and store them in another list. It would be
   better to generate them one at a time, so we need only the memory for a
   single permutation. This can be done using <small>CPS</small>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a sketch of an OCaml function
   called <tt>permuting</tt> that generates permutations in this way. It
   takes three arguments: a continuation called <tt>etc</tt>, a list of
   distinct things that have been permuted called <tt>permutedThings</tt>,
   and a list of distinct things that have not yet been permuted called
   <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>. We don&rsquo;t care what the
   <i>things</i> are: they might be characters, numbers, strings, etc.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> is empty, then call <tt>etc</tt> on
    <tt>permutedThings</tt>, then stop.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> is not empty, then choose a thing from
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> somehow. Make a new list of
    <tt>permutedThings</tt>, by adding the chosen thing to the front of
    <tt>permutedThings</tt>. Make a new list of
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>, by removing the chosen thing from
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>. Call <tt>permuting</tt> recursively
    with <tt>etc</tt>, the new <tt>permutedThings</tt>, and the new
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Go back to step 2, but choose a different thing from
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> this time. Continue until all the things
    have been chosen once, then stop.
   </p>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">
   Each time we call <tt>permuting</tt>, the list
   <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> is smaller. That means it will eventually
   become empty, and <tt>permuting</tt> will terminate at step 1. Also
   note that <tt>permuting</tt> is a <small>CPS</small> function: it
   <i>never</i> returns a permutation! Instead, every time it generates a
   permutation, it calls its continuation <tt>etc</tt>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, you may wonder how we use the
   permutations, since they are generated but never returned. The answer is
   that the continuation <tt>etc</tt> contains code that processes each
   permutation&#8212;in other words, it <i>continues</i> the computation
   for each permutation.
  </p>

   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   For this laboratory assignment, you must write the following OCaml
   functions. Of course you may write more helper functions if you need them.
   You will receive <b><small>ZERO POINTS</small></b> for this lab if
   you use loops, mutable objects, or variables.

   <dl compact="compact">

  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Here are some hints.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    You may want to use anonymous functions in your answer. An anonymous
    function with the parameter names <i>p</i>&#8321;,
    <i>p</i>&#8322; ..., <i>p&#8345;</i> and the body <i>e</i>
    is returned by
    <tt>(fun</tt>&nbsp;<i>p</i>&#8321;,&nbsp;<i>p</i>&#8322;&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<i>p&#8345;</i>&nbsp;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&nbsp;<i>e</i><tt>)</tt>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>choose</tt> is a <small>CPS</small> function, so
    it does not return a useful value. If you write it in the obvious way, then
    it will return <tt>()</tt>. You may need to use the OCaml semicolon
    operator &lsquo;<tt>;</tt>&rsquo;, which executes its arguments in
    order, and then returns the result of the last one. For example,
    <i>e</i>&#8321;&nbsp;<tt>;</tt>&nbsp;<i>e</i>&#8322;&nbsp;...<tt>;</tt>&nbsp;<i>e&#8345;</i>
    executes <i>e</i>&#8321;, <i>e</i>&#8322; ...,
    <i>e&#8345;</i> in left-to-right order and returns the result of
    <i>e&#8345;.</i>
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>allbut</tt> is not a <small>CPS</small>
    function: it returns a list. You wrote a function very much like
    <tt>allbut</tt> in the first laboratory assignment for this course.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>permute</tt> is a <small>CPS</small> function,
    so it does not return a useful value. If you write it in the obvious way,
    then it will return <tt>()</tt>. It must use something like
    <tt>permuting</tt> (described in the previous section) as a helper. It
    must also use <tt>choose</tt> and <tt>allbut</tt> as helpers.
   </p>
  </ul>

   The file

   lists. Run the tests, using <tt>printThings</tt> to print their
   results. When you think your code is correct, then submit your code in a
   file called <tt>lab4.ml</tt>. If you do not know how to submit your
   file, then please ask your lab section TA&rsquo;s. It must be submitted by
